2. After 4 colors have been picked the build phase will start.
3. The build phase will start with the first player who picked a color 
and will snake through each player until everyone has placed 2 settlements and 2 roads.
4. After the build phase concludes press end turn to start the game. 
5. The game will then progress like any normal Catan game! The current
